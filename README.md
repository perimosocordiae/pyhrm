Tools for analyzing and running Human Resource Machine programs

[Human Resource Machine](http://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine)
is a fun little game about programming, so naturally I felt compelled
to write more programs to work with my in-game programs.

To export programs from your game, use the copy button in game then paste
your program into a text editor.

##  Usage

 * `interpreter.py`: Runs a program, given the initial memory state and inbox contents.
 * `extract_images.py`: Displays the embedded images from a program.
